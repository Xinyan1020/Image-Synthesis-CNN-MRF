# Image-Synthesis-CNN-MRF
This is the code and the results of our project for the course Computational Imaging with the subject : Combination of Convolutional Network and Markov Random Field for image synthesis. 
In this project, we replaced the VGG-19 network, which was used to extract the featres, with a pretrained Inception-V3 network. We tested the effect of some parameters on the results : We have changed the content and loss layers, the content loss weight, the style loss weight, the patch size and
